# FUGAZI: The First Fully On-chain Dark Pool on Fhenix

This repository contains the final result of Orakle Dark Pool Team's hard work and is submitted to ETHOnline 2024. Fugazi is the first fully on-chain dark pool built on Fhenix. Unlike many other dark pools, Fugazi does not require any external or centralized entity to work, thanks to the fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) supported by Fhenix Helium Testnet.

## What is Dark Pool?

TBD

## Why Do We Need Decentralized Dark Pool?

TBD

## How Does It Work?

Fugazi usese following 3 tools to hide order information:

- FHE
- Batch Execution
- Noise Order

### FHE

TBD

### Batch Execution

TBD

### Noise Order
